# LOL Code Interpreter

A LOL Code Interpreter with a GUI for executing LOL Code scripts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 and above)
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

### Installing Dependencies

If you don't have Tkinter installed, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install tk
```

## Running the Interpreter

To execute the LOL Code Interpreter you can run the following: 

```bash
python lol_code_interpreter.py
```

This will launch the LOL Code Interpreter GUI. From there, you can open LOL Code files, edit the code, and execute it using the provided controls.

Make sure to replace "yourusername" with your actual GitHub username and adjust other details based on your project's structure.

## Using the GUI

Once the GUI is open, you can:

- **Open a LOL Code File:** Click on the "Open" button to select a LOL Code file using the file dialog.

- **Edit Code:** Directly edit the LOL Code in the text editor.

- **Execute Code:** Press the "Execute" button to run the LOL Code.

## Important Notes

- Ensure your LOL Code file has the ".lol" extension.

- The interpreter uses a simple GUI with a text editor for code input.
